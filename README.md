#Microsoft Office Fonts
This repository has the most used Microsoft Office fonts. I created this repo because I am using Linux and I always struggle to find the fonts for Fedora.
I did some research and font free fonts that can just be downloded (ttf files) and placed into a special folder which will make the fonts available to Linux applications like Libre Office.
##Steps
1) Download all the TTF files from this repo.
2) Copy them into a folder in your home directory ($HOME).
   The folder is called, /$HOME/.local/share/fonts
   My fonts folder did not exists so I just created it under the share folder.
